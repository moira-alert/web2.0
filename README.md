## Contributing

First of all thank you for your help!

For contributors we have two major rules:

- Put issues [in main repo](https://github.com/moira-alert/moira/issues), please. Even if you think, that your issue only about web interface. In many cases that's no so.
- If you want to send PR, checkout you feature branch from `master` and name it by template `feature/%feautre_name%`. When you send PR alson choice `master` as base.
